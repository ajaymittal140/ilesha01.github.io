Warning Signs

How to Help

Suicide is one of the top causes of death in the U.S., with rates rising across the country. Nearly 45,000 Americans died by suicide in 2016, according to the CDC.

Suicide is preventable. And that starts with knowing what to look for and what to do.

If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800-273-8255). It’s always open, and you can speak to a trained counselor.<br><br>

If someone is threatening to kill themselves, don’t leave them alone. Call 911 or, if you can do it safely, take them to the nearest emergency room. Try to keep the person calm, and get help from others.

Warning Signs

People who commit suicide don’t want to die, but to end their pain. Don’t dismiss their talk of suicide as just threats. If you notice any signs that they may be thinking about harming themselves, get help.

Focuses on death. Some people talk openly about wanting to die or to commit suicide. Or they dwell on the topic of death and dying. They may research ways to kill themselves or buy a gun, knife, or pills.<br><br><br>
